First, download the zip and extract it, then open the extracted folder in a program that execute java code and execute it, like eclipse IDE.
If the program you are going to open the proyect gives you two or more options, only open the proyect that contains 1 folder.
For example, if the proyect you are going to open have this path: RPG-Java-main\RPG-Java-main, DO NOT OPEN IT, uncheck that option, you MUST OPEN and check the 1 folder proyect, like RPG-Java-main.
